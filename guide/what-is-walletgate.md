# What is WalletGate?

WalletGate is the premier **Verifier/Relying Party** solution for the EU Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem. We provide businesses with a complete platform to accept, verify, and process digital identity credentials from EU citizens and residents.

## The Problem We Solve

The EU is rolling out Digital Identity Wallets to all 450 million citizens by 2026. While this creates massive opportunities for businesses, implementing a compliant verifier system is incredibly complex:

- ❌ **Cryptographic complexity**: RSA-PSS, ECDSA, certificate chain validation
- ❌ **Regulatory compliance**: eIDAS 2.0, GDPR, national regulations
- ❌ **Infrastructure setup**: LOTL fetching, OCSP/CRL checking, trust anchors
- ❌ **Security requirements**: API key management, webhook signing, audit logs
- ❌ **Ongoing maintenance**: Certificate updates, regulatory changes, security patches

**Building this in-house costs €500K-€1M+ and takes 6-12 months.**

## Our Solution

WalletGate provides a **5-line SDK integration** that handles all the complexity:

```typescript
import { WalletGate } from '@walletgate/eudi';

const client = new WalletGate({ apiKey: 'wg_test_...' });

const session = await client.createSession({
  checks: [{ type: 'age_over', value: 18 }],
});
```

That's it. We handle everything else.
